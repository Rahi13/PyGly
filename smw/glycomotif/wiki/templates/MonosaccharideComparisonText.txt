== Monosaccharide Comparison ==

Each specific characteristic (anomeric configuration, etc.) of the glycan and motif monosaccharides are considered to be sets. Missing characteristics represent a set containing all possible values. For a strict alignment, glycan monosaccharide characteristics must be contained in (or, a subset of) the corresponding motif monosaccharide characteristics. For a non-strict alignment, glycan monosaccharide characteristics must have an non-empty intersection with the corresponding motif monosaccharide characteristics.

Since monosaccharide characteristics either have a single value or are missing, we can simplify the above rules as follows:

1. have the same number of carbon atoms (HEX, PENT, etc.); and 

2. have the same stem-type (Man, Glc, etc.), if the motif monosaccharide stem-type is specified; and

3. have the same orientation (D-type, L-type), if the motif monosaccharide orientation is specified.

For a strict alignment, aligned motif and glycan monosaccharides must also:

4a. have the same ring information (1:5, etc.), if the motif monosaccharide ring information is specified; and 

5a. have the same anomeric configuration (&alpha;, &beta;), if the motif monosaccharide anomeric configuration is specified.

For a non-strict alignment, aligned motif and glycan monosaccharides must also:

4b. have the same ring information (1:5, etc.), if the glycan and motif monosaccharide ring information are specified; and 

5b. have the same anomeric configuration (&alpha;, &beta;), if the glycan and motif monosaccharide anomeric configuration are specified.

| b-dglc-HEX-1:5
| a-dglc-HEX-1:5
| No. The both the motif and glycan monosaccharide anomeric configuration is specified and they are not the same. 
|-
| x-dglc-HEX-x:x
| a-dglc-HEX-1:5
| Yes, strict alignment. Most monosaccharide properties are the same, with the exception of anomeric configuration and the ring information. The motif monosaccharide anomeric configuration and ring information are not specified, so the glycan monosaccharide characteristics are contained in the motif monosaccharide characteristics.

For a strict alignment, aligned motif and glycan monosaccharides must:

6a. have the same modifications (deoxygenation, carbonyl, etc.) at the same position. 

For a non-strict alignment, aligned motif and glycan monosaccharides must:

6b. have the same modifications (deoxygenation, carbonyl, etc.) at the same position.

6b. have the same modifications (deoxygenation, carbonyl, etc.) at the same position, except for glycan reducing-end alditol.
