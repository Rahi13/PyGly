== Introduction ==

Glycan nonreducing-end alignment requires motif structures align with at least one connected substructure (subtree) at the nonreducing end of the glycan. Aligned motif and glycan monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages must respect the matching rules outlined below. A nonreducing-end alignment may be strict, when ''all'' resolutions of missing and undetermined glycan details are consistent with the motif. Non-strict alignments require ''at least one'' resolution of missing and undetermined glycan details be consistent with the motif. All monosaccharide or glycosidic bond comparisons must be consistent with strict alignment for the alignment to be considered strict. 

In addition, non-strict alignments permit additional phosphate and sulfate substituents on glycan monosaccharides are permitted, even when the motif does not indicate them. When ambiguity in glycan topology permits at least one motif-to-nonreducing-end alignment, the motif and glycan are considered to have a non-strict alignment. Strict motif alignments in the determined topology portion of an undetermined topology glycan are considered strict. 

Motif alignment to the non-reducing end of the glycan is achieved by requiring the motif non-reducing end monosaccharides align to glycan non-reducing end monosaccharides. 

Currently, nonreducing-end alignments are only used in the GlyGen motif collection.

Yes, strict alignment. Motif aligns to three of the glycan arms, motif nonreducing-end monosaccharide NeuAc aligns to glycan nonreducing-end monosaccharide.

Yes, non-strict alignment. At least one of the attachment sites for the undetermined NeuAc results in a nonreducing-end alignment of the motif.

Yes, non-strict alignment. Motif has a complete nonreducing-end alignment in undertermined substructure. Additional glycan Fucose is permitted because the GlcNAc is not a nonreducing monosaccharide for the motif or glycan.

No. Motif nonreducing-end NeuAc is aligned with internal glycan NeuAc. The motif does have a non-strict substructure alignment.
