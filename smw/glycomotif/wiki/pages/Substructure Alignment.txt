== Introduction ==

Glycan substructure alignment requires motif structures align with at least one connected substructure (subtree) of a glycan. The motif-aligned substructure is not constrained to the reducing end or non-reducing end of the glycan. Aligned motif and glycan monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages must respect the matching rules outlined below. A substructure alignment may be strict, when ''all'' resolutions of missing and undetermined glycan details are consistent with the motif. Non-strict alignments require ''at least one'' resolution of missing and undetermined glycan details be consistent with the motif. All monosaccharide or glycosidic bond comparisons must be consistent with strict alignment for the alignment to be considered strict.

In addition, non-strict alignments permit additional phosphate and sulfate substituents on glycan monosaccharides, even when the motif does not require them. When ambiguity in glycan topology permits at least one motif-to-substructure alignment, the motif and glycan are considered to have a non-strict alignment. Strict motif alignments in the determined topology portion of an undetermined topology glycan are considered strict. 

Substructure alignment is the default alignment strategy for motifs that do not have a reducing-end annotation of true.

Yes, strict alignment. A motif always aligns to itself.

Yes, strict alignment. Motif substructure alignment at the reducing-end of the glycan. Motif reducing-end anomeric configuration contains the  glycan reducing-end anomeric configuration.

Yes, non-strict alignment. Motif substructure alignment at the reducing-end of the glycan. All missing or undetermined details have at least one resolution consistent with the motif.

Yes, non-strict alignment. Motif substructure alignment at the reducing end of either arm. The undetermined attachment sites of the Fucose includes the arm GlcNAc residues, and all other monosaccharide and linkage details of the corresponding glycan substructure match. Motif aligns outside of the determined topology core.

Yes, non-strict alignment. Non-strict substructure alignment tolerates additional sulfate substituents not specified by the motif.

Yes, non-strict alignment. Non-strict substructure alignment tolerates an additional alditol motification not specified by the motif at the reducing end of the glycan. Note that the motif also does not specify its reducing-end ring information (x:x), which permits it to match the uncyclized ring information (0:0) of the glycan.
